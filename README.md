I am accessing the Tumble  API and gathering:
- 50 Posts for each of 2 users I'm going to search for
- For each post, I'll be accessing the post text, the number of images, the time posted, and the user who posted
- I'll write 2 CSV files, one for each user's search (even though searching for a user may result in posts they did not post themselves)
- Data in each CSV file: 4 columns -- text, number photos, time posted, name of user who posted
- URL for the API: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2
- If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: https://oauth.net/
